## Research

I am currently working on **image processing and computer vision** for plant growth and phenotyping, applying advanced AI techniques to analyze and model plant development.

### Past Research Projects
- **Anomaly Detection using GANs**  
  Developed a framework for identifying anomalies in time-series data using Generative Adversarial Networks.

- **Pedestrian Intention Prediction using Graph Neural Networks**  
  Designed a graph-based model to predict pedestrian movement in dynamic environments.

- **Generative AI for Geometric Shape Generation**  
  Built a GAN-based system to generate parametrically encoded geometric shapes with applications in computer vision.
