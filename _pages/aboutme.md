## About Me

Hi! My name is Fahimeh Orvati Nia. I am a PhD student in Computer Engineering at Texas A&M University, specializing in artificial intelligence, machine learning, and computer vision. Currently, I am working on **image processing and computer vision for plant growth and phenotyping**, focusing on leveraging advanced AI techniques to analyze and understand plant development.

Previously, I earned my Master of Science in Electrical Engineering from the University of Notre Dame, where I worked on **GAN-based anomaly detection** and **pedestrian intention prediction using graph neural networks**. I also hold a Bachelor of Science in Electrical Engineering (Control) from Amirkabir University of Technology.
