## About Me

I’m **Fahimeh Orvati Nia**, a PhD student in **Computer Engineering** at **Texas A&M University**, where I specialize in **artificial intelligence**, **computer vision**, and **machine learning**. My journey in academia has been driven by a deep passion for using cutting-edge technology to solve real-world challenges.

### My Current Work
Currently, my research focuses on:
- **Image Processing and Computer Vision**: I am working on innovative techniques for **plant growth and phenotyping**, leveraging advanced AI models to analyze and predict plant development patterns.
- **Generative AI**: I explore applications of generative adversarial networks (GANs) for **anomaly detection** and data generation tasks.
- **Graph Neural Networks**: My previous work includes developing GNN-based systems for **pedestrian intention prediction**, with applications in smart cities and autonomous systems.

### My Background
I completed my Master of Science in **Electrical Engineering** at the **University of Notre Dame**, where I delved into:
- Building GAN-based systems for detecting anomalies in time-series data.
- Applying graph neural networks for predictive modeling in human behavior.

Prior to that, I earned my Bachelor of Science in **Electrical Engineering (Control)** from **Amirkabir University of Technology**, where I gained a strong foundation in systems modeling and control theory.

### Skills & Expertise
Here are some of the areas where I excel:
- **Programming**: Python, MATLAB, TensorFlow, PyTorch, C++.
- **AI & Machine Learning**: Generative AI, Graph Neural Networks, Deep Learning Models.
- **Embedded Systems**: Raspberry Pi, STM32, Arduino.
- **Computer Vision Tools**: OpenCV, image preprocessing, and feature extraction.

### Beyond Research
Outside of academics, I enjoy:
- **Collaborating** with interdisciplinary teams to tackle complex problems.
- **Teaching and Mentoring**: Sharing knowledge and empowering others to explore the fascinating world of AI.
- **Exploring New Ideas**: I am always curious about integrating technology into fields like public health, neuroscience, and robotics.

### Why I Do What I Do
I believe that **technology is a tool for empowerment**, and I am committed to using my skills to make a positive impact in the world. Whether it's improving agricultural systems, enhancing public safety, or advancing medical research, my goal is to bridge the gap between innovation and application.
